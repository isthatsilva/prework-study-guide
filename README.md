# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The Prework Study Guide helped prepare me for bootcamp as I strive to become a web developer. It introduced me to the various languages that is needed to create a webpage such as: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Prework Study Guide also demonstrated how to use the command line and how to keep track changes in your code using Git.
